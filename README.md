CIFAR-10 Image Classification
This project demonstrates the process of building and comparing various machine learning models to classify images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

Project Overview
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Download and extract the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Load the dataset using Python's pickle module.
Normalize the image data to have values between 0 and 1.
Convert class labels to one-hot encoded vectors.
Model Selection:

Implement and evaluate various machine learning algorithms including:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Decision Trees
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Random Forests

Model Training and Validation:

Train each model using the training dataset.
Validate model performance using a separate validation dataset to tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.
Performance Evaluation:

Evaluate the models on the test dataset.
Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to compare model performance.
Visualization:

Visualize sample images from the dataset.
Plot training and validation metrics to assess model performance over time.
